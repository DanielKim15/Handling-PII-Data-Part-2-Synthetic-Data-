# Handling-PII-Data-Part-2-Synthetic-Data-
A continuation from the first part of handling PII data, in this part I'll be discussing about using a technique called synthetic data where we can generate fake data that follows similar properties of the original data (same summary statistics, similar mean and median, distribution is similar). (Goal: Use the ECF Task 4 data and then choose a few columns, run the flowr package for synthetic data and run two test to ensure it worked (the flowr package evaluation and the histogram/distrubution test)
